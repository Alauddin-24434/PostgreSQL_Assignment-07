-- Answers to the Questions

1. What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses and extends the SQL language, providing a robust platform for managing data.

2. What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?

A schema in PostgreSQL serves as a namespace that organizes database objects like tables, views, and indexes. It allows for better management and control of database elements.

3. Explain the primary key and foreign key concepts in PostgreSQL.

A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring that no two rows have the same key. A foreign key is a field that creates a link between two tables, referencing the primary key in another table, thus establishing a relationship.

4. What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?

VARCHAR is a variable-length string that can hold up to a specified number of characters, while CHAR is a fixed-length string that always uses the specified number of characters, padding with spaces if necessary.

5. Explain the purpose of the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement.

The WHERE clause filters records in a SELECT statement based on specified conditions, allowing retrieval of only those rows that meet the criteria.

6. What are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses used for?

The LIMIT clause restricts the number of rows returned by a query, while the OFFSET clause skips a specified number of rows before starting to return rows from the query.

7. How can you perform data modification using UPDATE statements?

The UPDATE statement modifies existing records in a table based on specified conditions in the WHERE clause.

8. What is the significance of the JOIN operation, and how does it work in PostgreSQL?

The JOIN operation combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column, allowing retrieval of related data across tables. PostgreSQL supports various types of joins, including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.

9. Explain the GROUP BY clause and its role in aggregation operations.

The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, often used with aggregate functions (like COUNT, SUM) to perform calculations on groups of data.

10. How can you calculate aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG in PostgreSQL?

Aggregate functions such as COUNT(), SUM(), and AVG() compute values from multiple rows. For instance, COUNT(column_name) counts non-null entries, SUM(column_name) adds values, and AVG(column_name) calculates the average of values in a specified column.
